## Setup
:floppy_disk:

Uses the following tools in this repository:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - Open-source, declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Itâ€™s maintained by Facebook, and it can be used to develop of single-page applications (SPA).
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
  - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
  - Open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client. Uses apollo-server-express package to integrate GraphQL into Express.js server, and the @apollo/client package to make requests from React front end to the GraphQL API.
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
  - All-in-one dependency that enables connection to a GraphQL API server and execute queries or mutations using their own special form of React Hooks.
- [concurrently](https://graphql.org/)
  - Runs multiple processes, or servers, from a single command-line interface, rather than opening multiple terminals to start multiple servers. Tracks multiple outputs in one place and will stop all processes if one fails.

Repository splits into `client` and `server` sections to handle different parts of the development mode.

## Usage
